# The-Clever-Adventurer

The Clever Adventurer offers a blend of gaming and learning, reminiscent of Super Mario's immersive world but with a focus on combining entertainment with educational value. Unlike Triviador, my game isn't about competitive quizzes but instead offers combines knowledge challenges seamlessly into the gameplay. As the player ventures into the unknown world he is met along the way with enemies as well as floating question marks representing the challenges. The goal of the game is to gain as many score points as possible. See the powerpoint presentation for more details.
